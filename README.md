# Arduino-RF433MHZ-ToyCar

I decided to build an Arduino RC Car using a 
much simple solution base on a $3 module called
RF 433 MHZ kit, which comes with a transmiter
and a receiver peace.

Here is the car :)

You will need to install
[RadioHead](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/) 
Amplitude Shift Keying Library. The wiring setup is described
