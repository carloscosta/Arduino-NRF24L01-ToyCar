# Arduino-NRF24L01-ToyCar

I am no longer using **NRF24L01** for this project.
I decided to use a much simple solution using a 
$3 RF 433 MHZ kit, which comes with a transmiter
and a receiver module. For more details about 
RF 433 visit
[this](https://www.instructables.com/id/RF-315433-MHz-Transmitter-receiver-Module-and-Ardu/)

You will need to install
[RadioHead](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/) 
Amplitude Shift Keying Library. The wiring setup is described 
[here](https://dronebotworkshop.com/433mhz-rf-modules-arduino/)
